### Hey there ðŸ‘‹,
I'm Christian Bernstein from Frankfurt, Germany.
Currently working on a modern, web-based SQL suite. 
Also fiddling around with a selfmade smarthome.

### languages and Tools

I've worked with these languages and tools listed here:
- Java
  - Advanced annotation processing
  - H2 database
  - RabbitMQ (message broker)
  - Netty

- Kotlin
  - JetBrains Xodus database [Github](https://github.com/JetBrains/xodus)
  - JetBrains Ktor Servers & Clients [Homepage](https://ktor.io/)

- TypeScript & JavaScript
  - React

### Other tech-related interests
One of my main tech-related interests is on compilers. 
Throughout my projects I wrote two simple LL(1) "compilers" *(tokenizer, parser & lexer)*. 
This peeked my interest in designing (programming) languages and developing more complex compilers and code generators.
I'm currently designing a scripting language for generating AI prompts and modelling the behaviour of advanced pipeline
processes. <br/>
*(Technical: A language-based alternative to the node-based approach used in ComfyUI 
to generate images using StableDiffusion)*
